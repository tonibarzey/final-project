	<h1> Self Love.</h1>
	<p> I realized my luck with getting a job as a full time black student in New York City was not going to work out so i finally had enough of high hopes and failure i could no longer be defeated by this city's expectations for how a worker for their company should look. I decided to become my own business women. I counted my blessing and prayed for a better outcome. I then started my own business by doing Make up and hair and i was finally acomplished.</p>
