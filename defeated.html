	<h1> Defated against employment system>.</h1>
	<p> I realize that it's been very hard in the system for people of color that's in college to get a job. Being discriminated against a hirring manager and not actually acknowledging it can be tough. I've had to experience this when me and a Afro Latina  was the only darker complexion amongst ligher complected females and the light complexion females got the job and myself and the afro latina was sent home and told we'll be coalled with in a week. This happened on 34th street in Manhattan. I felt deafetd due to the fact that this has not been one of the first time ajob has tuned me away and picked somone with a lighter complexin than me.  </p>
