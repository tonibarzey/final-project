	<h1> It begins with us! </h1>
	<p> Just because you see someones skin color does not mean you can see their story, thier truth, or thier personality. Someone may seem dull to you and not as uplifting because you didnt find the immediate chance to understand their persona. It can be something so small and simple that will lighten up any characteristics such as a pretty colored umbrella or scarf. I say this because a splash of color can show a a lot of a persons character on the inside. Moral of my view point is dont judge a book by it's cover understand them first. </p>
